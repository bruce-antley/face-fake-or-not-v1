# ðŸ§  face-fake-or-not-v1

> A ResNet50-based image classifier fine-tuned on real and AI-generated faces using FastAI.

This project explores whether an image of a human face is real or AI-generated ("fake"). It's built using the [FastAI](https://www.fast.ai) library, which simplifies deep learning workflows while leveraging PyTorch under the hood. This version uses a ResNet50 backbone, trained and fine-tuned across progressively harder datasets.

### ðŸ“¸ Demo

Here's an example of the model in action, hosted on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/BA-Baracus/face_fake_or_not_v1):

### ðŸ“Š Model Evolution & Performance

The model went through multiple rounds of fine-tuning:

| Round     | Real Accuracy | Fake Accuracy |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Round 0   | 98.0%         | 5.6%           |
| Round 1   | 51.3%         | 79.6%          |
| Round 2   | 92.2%         | 55.6%          |

- **Round 0** was trained on relatively easy examples.
- **Round 1** was tuned on very hard fakes, causing a drop in real accuracy.
- **Round 2** attempted to balance both, yielding improved performance on both.
